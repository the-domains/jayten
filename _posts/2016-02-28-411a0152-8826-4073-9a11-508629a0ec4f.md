I am Jamie. A User Experience Designer, with over 16 years of experience designing digital products.

About me

Originating from a Multimedia Design degree I have always been intrigued by how people experience everyday objects. My past experiences have always focused on how the user or customer is going to experience the service or product I am designing.

This has naturally led me into the world of UX, with an eye on predicting new ways people will interact and experience services & products in the future.

I have an agile approach to the way I design experiences, mixing in a strong eye for the aesthetic with my knowledge of experience design. Combining practical skills with theory, research and strategy, I am able to design enhanced and innovative outcomes.
